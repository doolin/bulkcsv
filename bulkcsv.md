* [Mass inserting coffeepower style](https://www.coffeepowered.net/2009/01/23/mass-inserting-data-in-rails-without-killing-your-performance/), a bit dated, still useful.
* [ActiveRecord connection insert](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/ConnectionAdapters/DatabaseStatements.html#method-i-insert) is *fast*, but only returns the last auto-generated id.
